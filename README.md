# *Full-Stack Hepatitis Classification Project*

## Overview:
A robust full-stack project designed for the classification of hepatitis instances into two distinct classes: Class 1 and Class 2. This system seamlessly integrates both backend and frontend components to provide users with a smooth and efficient experience in hepatitis classification.

## Key Components:

### Backend:

1. **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a classification model on hepatitis dataset.
3. **Data Handling:** Efficiently manages and preprocesses hepatitis data for model training and predictions.
4. **Classification Logic:** Implements classification logic for predicting hepatitis classes.

### Frontend:

1. **User Interface:** Offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.
2. **Input Forms:** Provides forms for users to input relevant data for hepatitis classification.
3. **Real-time Feedback:** Displays real-time feedback on the predicted class.

## Usage:

1. **Access the Application:** Open the application through a web browser or a dedicated client.
2. **Input Data:** Fill in the required data in the provided forms.
3. **Submit:** Submit the input for classification.
4. **View Results:** Receive real-time feedback on the predicted hepatitis class.
